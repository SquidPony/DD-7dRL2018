/**
 * Base information for world level biomes. The lists of lists of biomes that can border a specific
 * biome indicates what has to be present for this biome to be placed. All the biomes in at least
 * one of the sublists must be present.
 *
 * Note that the world should start with one biome ignoring its requirements so that more can be
 * added after that one.
 *
 * An arbitrary example might be that a lake can have mountain and glacier as a border or swamp and
 * river, but must have one of those two sets to exist.
