/**
 * This is used to create specific recipes in a game world.
 *
 * A blueprint is used instead of direct recipes so that more randomness in the recipes is
 * available. Multiple in-game recipes may be created from a single blueprint, each with somewhat
 * different end results based on this blueprint's parameters.
 *
 * The optional consumed and catalyst parts may be present in any combination, with each providing
 * its own changes to the resulting outcome.
 *
 * The difference in which optional things are used and which children of all recipe elements are
 * required is what makes different versions of each recipe possible.
 *
 * The total recipe including results is built at a single time and using special children classes
 * of ingredients does not infer any bonus results not in the built recipe. This may mean that more
 * specific recipes tend to be of higher value but also both harder to find and harder to follow.
 *
 * For example one cake recipe might call for any egg and any flour while another might call for a
 * robin egg and almond flour. Both come from the same base cake recipe but if the first is used
 * then the special properties from a robin egg and almond flour do not get contributed as they
 * would in a more specific recipe.
